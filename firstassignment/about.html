				<h3 id="about-me">ABOUT ME</h3>
				<p>
					My name is Mariam Oluwole, I hold a degree in Medical Microbiology and
					currently enrolled to Alt School Africa Front End Engineering. I
					envision to become a medical Solution Engineer. I am currently working
					in the Health care Sector. I am a person who is positive about every
					aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to
					experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like
					to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise
					in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel
					the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the
					ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I
					like to do thoughtful experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of
					the night. I like to sleep late, I like to get up early; I like to be
					alone, I like my private space. I like country’s peace, I like
					metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like
					the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable
					shoes; I like good books and Sci-fic movies. I like the land and the
					nature. And, I like to laugh.
